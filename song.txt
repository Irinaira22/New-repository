I see you
You see me
How pleasant
This feeling
The moment
You hold me
I missed you
I'm sorry
I've given
What I have
I showed you
I'm growing
The ashes
Fall slowly
As your voice
Consoles me
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

[Bridge]
The night will hold us close, and the stars will guide us home
I've been waiting for this moment, we're finally alone
I turn to ask the question, so anxious, my thoughts
Your lips were soft like winter, in your passion, I was lost

[Chorus]
As the hours pass, I will let you know
[Chorus]
As the hours pass, I will let you know
That I need to ask, before I'm alone
How it feels to rest on your patient lips
To eternal bliss, I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass, I will let you know
That I need to ask, before I'm alone
How it feels to rest on your patient lips
To eternal bliss, I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass, I will let you know
That I need to ask, before I'm alone
How it feels to rest on your patient lips
To eternal bliss, I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass, I will let you know
That I need to ask, before I'm alone
How it feels to rest on your patient lips
To eternal bliss, I'm so glad to know
